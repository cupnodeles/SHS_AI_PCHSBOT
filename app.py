    Why is STEM important?
The global economy is changing. Current jobs are disappearing due to automation and new jobs are emerging every day as a result of technological advances.

The continual advances in technology are changing the way students learn, connect and interact every day. Skills developed by students through STEM provide them with the foundation to succeed at school and beyond.

Employer demand for STEM qualifications and skills is high, and will continue to increase in the future. Currently, 75 per cent of jobs in the fastest growing industries require workers with STEM skills. To be competitive, the Australian workforce needs people who can adapt to a changing workplace.

STEM empowers individuals with the skills to succeed and adapt to this changing world.  


Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an umbrella term used to group together the distinct but related technical disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The term is typically used in the context of education policy or curriculum choices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area), and immigration policy, with regard to admitting foreign students and tech workers.[1]

There is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular, whether or not the science in STEM includes social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, and political science. In the United States, these are typically included by the National Science Foundation (NSF),[1] the Department of Labor's O*Net online database for job seekers,[2] and the Department of Homeland Security.[3] In the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym HASS (humanities, arts, and social sciences),[citation needed] rebranded in 2020 as SHAPE (social sciences, humanities and the arts for people and the economy).[4][5] Some sources also use HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) as the counterpart of STEM.[citation needed]

Terminology
History
In the early 1990s the acronym STEM was used by a variety of educators. Beverly Schwartz developed a STEM mentoring program in the Capital District of New York State, and was using the acronym as early as November, 1991.[6] Charles E. Vela was the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)[7][8][9] and started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, D.C. area called the STEM Institute. Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education,[10] Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics, and engineering education.[11] Previously referred to as SMET by the NSF,[12] it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM. One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which was founded in 1998.[13] In 2001, at the urging of Dr. Peter Faletra, the Director of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists at the Office of Science, the acronym was adopted by Rita Colwell and other science administrators in the National Science Foundation (NSF). The Office of Science was also an early adopter of the STEM acronym.

What is ABM Strand?
The ABM strand in senior high school is designed to arm students with the foundational knowledge and skills needed for careers in accountancy, business management, and entrepreneurship. This strand focuses on subjects such as business mathematics, economics, accounting principles, and management concepts, providing a robust academic framework for understanding the complexities of the business world. Through a blend of theoretical instruction and practical applications, students gain a comprehensive understanding of financial management, strategic planning, and ethical business practices.

In addition to core business subjects, the ABM strand emphasizes the development of critical thinking, analytical skills, and effective communication. Students engage in various projects, case studies, and business simulations that mirror real-world scenarios, enhancing their ability to analyze situations and make informed decisions.

This hands-on approach ensures that ABM graduates are not only well-prepared for higher education in business-related fields, but also equipped with the practical skills needed to thrive in diverse business environments.

What are the Objectives of the ABM Strand?
The ABM strand is designed with specific objectives to prepare students for successful careers in the business sector.

What is the Best Track in Senior High School?
Now that you have an overview of the senior high school tracks, you might wonder what the best track among these is. Unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Why? Determining the best track in senior high school is subjective and depends on individual interests, skill sets, higher education plans, and career goals. Each track is designed to cater to different preferences and aspirations, providing students with diverse opportunities for growth and development.

However, the best track is one that allows you to grow, develop essential skills, and pursue a path that matches your personal goals and aspirations. Selecting the right track sets the foundation for a successful academic journey and, subsequently, a fulfilling career.

How to Choose the Best Track for Senior High School
Choosing the best track for senior high school is a significant decision that requires careful consideration of various factors. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this crucial choice:

1. Assess yourself.
Begin by reflecting on your interests, strengths, and passion. Consider the subjects you enjoy the most and the activities that bring you satisfaction. Identifying your personal preferences can guide you toward a track that aligns with your intrinsic motivations.

2. Conduct career exploration.
Research potential careers and industries that appeal to you. Know the educational requirements for those careers and determine which tracks are most relevant. You might also want to take personality tests to help you find the track and strand that suits you best.

3. Identify your academic inclinations.
Evaluate your academic strengths and preferences. If you excel in subjects like mathematics and science, then the STEM track might be a good fit. Alternatively, if you have a strong affinity for the arts and humanities, then the arts and design or the HUMSS track may be more suitable.

4. Consider long-term goals.
Think about your long-term educational and career goals. If you plan to pursue a specific course or profession in college, choose a track that aligns with the prerequisites for that field. Some higher education programs may require specific SHS tracks for admission.

5. Look for the best school that offers your chosen track and strand.
Once you’ve determined the track that best suits your interests and goals, it’s also important to find the best school that offers that particular track and strand. Most schools have embraced the K-12 program, providing a variety of tracks to cater to diverse student needs. However, you should enroll in a school that delivers top-notch education. They can equip you with the right skills and knowledge to help you reach your dreams faster!

The GAS strand is created to cater to students who prefer a broader range of studies rather than specific fields. It offers SHS students the flexibility to choose electives from various strands, which helps in choosing a university degree. This article provides an overview of this strand including some courses that they can take for successful career paths in the future.
